# Hi, I'm Alex! ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring web developer, focusing mostly on Javascript and React. My alias Rex Basiliscus is something I have used for years, and you can also find me under that name in the dev team for [RTR: Imperium Surrectum mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2487698001) for Rome Remastered strategy game, where I contribute as a historian and developer. Check us out on our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/8VQTnBSM8t)!
